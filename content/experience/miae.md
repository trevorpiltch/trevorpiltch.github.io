# VP Finance
[Website](https://studentpresidentmi.wixsite.com/website)
### About
The McGill Institute for Aerospace Engineering is a collection of McGill professors, students, and Montreal professionals, looking to advance research and knowledge in aerospace engineering. As VP finance for the student executive committee, I manage a budget exceeding $3,000. I ensure the strategic allocation of resources for impactful student events and educational workshops. By carefully balancing financial constraints with programming goals, I've successfully facilitated numerous guest speaker events, providing valuable networking and learning opportunities for our members. 

### Skills 
_Excel, PowerPoint_\
While not a computer technical role, this position has helped me become a better team worker. We have weekly meetings, I communicate with the administration and various companies for events and help write an end of semester report. This has taught me important non-technical skills that I wouldn't otherwise get from a technical project.
