### About
I got interested in skateboarding over the COVID-19 pandemic, and bought a 7.5" Alienware board to learn. I rode the board almost everyday through my neighborhood, and I wanted to know how fast and far I was going. Since I had just learned Swift a year before, I figured that this was a good opportunity to build a mobile app. \
The app was released to the public in early 2023 and has reached over 500 downloads on every continent. The pace of growth has increased as well, with almost 200 new users joining in the last two months alone. The app has also had a favorable rating on the app store, consitently with 5.0/5.0 stars.

### Skills
_Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftTesting, CoreData, SwiftData, Figma, Xcode_ \
I designed a simple UI in Figma and built it using SwiftUI. To implement the backend, I utilized CoreData, CoreLocation, and the Swift language. The app utilizes GPS data to show current location, speed, and distance and the database can keep track of boards in a riders collection. It also integrates into the iOS ecosystem using live activities, widgets, and Siri shortcuts.  \
In hindsight, I should've spend more time designing the system architecture before coding but this was the first large project I embarked on so I give myself some leeway. For version 3.0, I've migrated the backend to the modern SwiftData backend, along with completely redesigning the frontend to be easier to use.
