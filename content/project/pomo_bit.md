### About
The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a technique of completing 25 minutes of deep work, followed by five minutes of real rest. Whenever I get stuck on a problem, I usually find the solution after stepping a way for a bit but I still find it hard to take that break and clear my head. Since I had the Micro:Bit v2 lying around, I decided to convert it into a simple pomodoro timer for my desk. I've found that having a physical object, separate from a Mac or phone app, helps me stay focused and avoid distractions.
