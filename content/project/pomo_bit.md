In the world of digital distractions, sometimes the best solution is a physical one. This project transforms a [Micro:Bit v2](https://microbit.org/) into a dedicated Pomodoro timer, bringing the power of focused work sessions right to your desk.

### Highlights
- **Hardware:** Utilizes the Micro:Bit v2 platform
- **Software:** Written in C using open source HAL libraries
- **Functionality:** Alternates between 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks

### Personal Impact
Since implementing this timer, I've noticed that I'm more deliberate with my breaks. Before, I used a phone or mac app to track my breaks and ended up wasting my time on email or social media. This provides a visual and tactile separation between work time and break time.
