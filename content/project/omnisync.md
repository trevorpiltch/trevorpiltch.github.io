# OmniSync
[Repo](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/omnifocus-sync) \
This is a forked repo from the original project [here](https://github.com/mikerhodes/github-to-omnifocus) which only allowed imports from GitHub. I wanted to add other sources, so I forked the repo (under the ISC license) and began modifying the original Go scripts.

### Highlights
- **Software:** Written in Go, utilizing existing open source code
- **Features:** Import Shortcut and GitHub issues to a specific OmniFocus project

### Personal Impact
I don't think I use a piece of software more than I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus). Since 2019, I've kept every actionable item in my life organized in this app. As I got more into software, I realized there wasn't an easy way to sync the various bug tracking tools to OmniFocus. I found a script written [here](https://github.com/mikerhodes/github-to-omnifocus) (released under the open source ISC license) for syncing GitHub issues to OmniFocus. I modified the code to accept inputs from the Shortcut tool and am working to add other sources as well.
