# Labs
[Repo](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/Labs) \
Have you ever found yourself stuck in a cycle of passive learning, endlessly consuming books and videos without making tangible progress? I've been there too. This project is my answer to that common pitfall.

### Overview
This repository serves as my personal "lab" for learning. It's a curated collection of:
- **Projects:** applications built from tutorials 
- **Scripts:** small, focused code snippets to test ideas
