# Labs
[Repo](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/Labs) \
Have you ever found yourself stuck in a cycle of passive learning, endlessly consuming books and videos without making tangible progress? I've been there too. This project is my answer to that common pitfall.

### Overview
This repository serves as my personal "lab" for learning. It's a curated collection of:
- **Projects:** applications built from tutorials 
- **Scripts:** small, focused code snippets to test ideas

### Current Repo
Currently, the repository contains the following repos: \
[Depo Tutorial:](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/Depot-Tutorial/tree/76b1f65ce90b76eb41eec5750ddd0138b58d8f59) the demo application [Agile Web Development with Rails 6](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails6/agile-web-development-with-rails-6/#resource) which I used to teach myself Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 


[Arm Assembly:](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/arm-assembly/tree/5e4387c8c61bb96b2f46fe09fd12d799855f6142) the code from [Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-with-64-bit/9781484258811) that I used to teach myself the basics of Assembly. 

[Go Language:](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/go/tree/7fa55cd9cada1ba666611c743828c0ca8b40aecc) a collection of different command line utilities built from [Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/powerful-command-line-applications/9781680509311/) that I used to learn the Go language.
