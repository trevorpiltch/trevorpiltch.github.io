My motivation behind learning assembly comes mainly from my work on the McGillRocket team, where I am in charge of the flight computer software. This system uses a lot of low-level C/C++ code that needs to be optimized. In order to better understand the code compilation, and write code more efficiently, I wanted to learn about how the code worked under the hood. Hence, I decided to learn assembly.
