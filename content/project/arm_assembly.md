description: I've gotten interested in low-level C/C++ code from leading the McGill Rocket Team Flight Computer project which led me to look into Assembly to see what was going on under the hood.

# ARM Assembly
**Disclaimer:** All the code from this project is credited to the author of [this](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-with-64-bit/9781484258811) book. \
While working for the McGill Rocket Team, I was trying to debug an issue with operating system task scheduling. When stepping through the program, it would halt at a specific section of Assembly instructions. Since I had absolutely zero idea what was going on in that section (I was still a year or two from university assembly courses), I decided that was a good time to learn a little about Assembly. I found the aforementioned book and began reading, taking notes, and writing code. Once I'm done, I'm planning on creating a personal project in Assembly, although I'm not entirely sure what that's going to be yet.
