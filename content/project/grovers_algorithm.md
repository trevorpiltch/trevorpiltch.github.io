# Grovers Algorithm
[Repo](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/Grovers-Algorithm) \
For my final project in CS590 (Computer Architecture) at Phillips Exeter Academy, I delved into the cutting-edge world of quantum computing by implementing [Grover's search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm).

### Highlights
- **Algorithm:** Grover's algorithm, a quantum method for unstructured search
- **Performance:** Achieves \(O(\sqrt({N}))\), showcasing quantum speedup
- **Framework:** Implemented using IBM's [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit)

### Learning Outcomes
This project provided hands-on experience with: 
- Quantum gates and their implementations
- Practical application of quantum computing concepts
- Advanced mathematical principles in computing

While the underlying mathematics and physics proved challenging, this project significantly enhanced my understanding of quantum computing principles and their potential impact on future computer architectures.
