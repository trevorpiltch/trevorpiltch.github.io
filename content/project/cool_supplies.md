This project was the main content of the my course in model-based programming. I was part of a group of seven students, and unanimously voted as the technical leader. For the application, we used Java, Gradle, Cucumber, and JavaFX. Most of the group had never completed an application this large before, and I took it upon myself to teach them some critical software engineering skills. I taught them the basics of git, Java, and how to create an intuitive UI in JavaFX (and not use the default styling). 

After some very late nights, we presented our application in front of the entire class in a live demo. The demo went flawlessly, and the professor's only comment was "wow". We then won an award for our application, as it was voted best in class. 

While not my most technical project, I'm very proud of this application. It taught me how to lead a team and, despite the challenges of working with less experienced students, how to achieve great results.
