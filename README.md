# Personal Website
[![Deploy Hugo site to Pages](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/trevorpiltch.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trevorpiltch/trevorpiltch.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yaml)

## About
This is the project code for this website, written using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework. I decided to migrate from my original plan of designing from scratch, 
because I wanted to showcase more of what I've done. This is actually pretty easy in Hugo, because I can generate most of the page from markdown files. Most of the work 
came from modifying the original [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/) to get the look and feel I wanted. 

## Building + Deploying
The site is built and deployed using a GitHub action specifically made for Hugo sites.
