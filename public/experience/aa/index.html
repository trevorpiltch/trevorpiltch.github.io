<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>AlwaysArt is a startup based in California looking to connect artists, galleries, and collectors. I built their internal app in Swift and SwiftUI, interfacing with the live production backend (running on Ruby on Rails). The app helped increase inventory management from around 200 items to over 20000 utilizing QR code scanning and a responsive UI. <br>
When the company wanted to release their mobile application, the CEO hired me to build it for them. I expanded the iOS application to include a consumer facing side, that includes an artwork photo gallery, artwork lookup, and full account management. I also added system integration through widgets and spotlight to enhance the user experience. <br>
I then taught myself JetPack compose and Kotlin to implement the app for android devices. This was a fun challenge, as I had never done android development before. The android app has feature parity with the iOS app, and includes the same system integrations, providing a consistent look and feature set.</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>Swift, SwiftUI, Kotlin, JetPack Compose, Ruby on Rails <br>
I actually learned Swift as one of my first programming languages, but this was one of the first projects where the Swift code I wrote was used by someone other than myself. Due to this, and the fact that the app was interfacing with production servers, I taught myself common design patterns and testing strategies to prevent any catastrophic failures. I also taught myself Ruby and Ruby on Rails so I could understand what was going on in the server.</p>
