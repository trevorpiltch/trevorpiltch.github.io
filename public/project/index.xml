      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;arm-assembly&#34;&gt;ARM Assembly&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; All the code from this project is credited to the author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-with-64-bit/9781484258811&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; book. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;While working for the McGill Rocket Team, I was trying to debug an issue with operating system task scheduling. When stepping through the program, it would halt at a specific section of Assembly instructions. Since I had absolutely zero idea what was going on in that section (I was still a year or two from university assembly courses), I decided that was a good time to learn a little about Assembly. I found the aforementioned book and began reading, taking notes, and writing code. Once I&amp;rsquo;m done, I&amp;rsquo;m planning on creating a personal project in Assembly, although I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what that&amp;rsquo;s going to be yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;labs&#34;&gt;Labs&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen into the trap of reading books and watching videos while trying to learn something. Taking the idea from science, this repo contains labs for gaining hands-on experience writing software. It contains projects, scripts, and experiments that I use to learn and explore new languages and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
