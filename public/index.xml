      <title>ARM Assembly</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;arm-assembly&#34;&gt;ARM Assembly&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; All the code from this project is credited to the author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-with-64-bit/9781484258811&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; book. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;While working for the McGill Rocket Team, I was trying to debug an issue with operating system task scheduling. When stepping through the program, it would halt at a specific section of Assembly instructions. Since I had absolutely zero idea what was going on in that section (I was still a year or two from university assembly courses), I decided that was a good time to learn a little about Assembly. I found the aforementioned book and began reading, taking notes, and writing code. Once I&amp;rsquo;m done, I&amp;rsquo;m planning on creating a personal project in Assembly, although I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what that&amp;rsquo;s going to be yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;labs&#34;&gt;Labs&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen into the trap of reading books and watching videos while trying to learn something. Taking the idea from science, this repo contains labs for gaining hands-on experience writing software. It contains projects, scripts, and experiments that I use to learn and explore new languages and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flight Computer Software Lead</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;flight-computer-software-lead&#34;&gt;Flight Computer Software Lead&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The McGill Rocket Team (MRT) is a completely student run design team, focused on designing and launching a hybrid engine rocket. I joined the Flight Computer Software project in my first year at the university, and quickly gained an interest in the work. My first project was fixing a timing issue with an I2C bus. I then worked with another member to implement drivers for new acceleration, temperature, and pressure sensors. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was then elected by the team captains to become the new project lead in May 2024. Our planned launch was late August 2024 (at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.launchcanada.org/&#34;&gt;Launch Canada&lt;/a&gt; competition), and I worked throughout the summer to get the system ready for launch. In this time, I re-designed the system to use FreeRTOS and concurrent programming techniques (mutexes, queues, threads, etc.). I also implemented new commands to interface with the propulsion, radio, and payload systems over CAN buses, exhaustively tested a new SD card driver, and implemented a driver for a new video recorder inside the rocket. Although the rocket ultimately didn&amp;rsquo;t fly (due to a faulty fuel valve), the software system worked throughout the testing and various launch attempts. After the competition, I designed the new software system architecture, trained new members, and managed my team of around 8-9 people. I hosted weekly meetings along with work sessions and social events such as hackathons and team wide BBQs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
