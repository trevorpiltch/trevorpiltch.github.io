      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;robot-forest&#34;&gt;Robot Forest&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://robotforest.dev&#34;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Robot Forest, we believe that mobile applications should be more than just functional tools – they should be thoughtfully crafted experiences that seamlessly integrate into people&amp;rsquo;s lives. Our studio was born from a vision to bridge the gap between technological innovation and human-centered design, creating mobile solutions that feel as natural and intuitive as walking through a forest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I founded Robot Forest with a simple yet powerful mission: to build mobile applications that make a genuine difference in how people interact with technology. Drawing from years of experience in mobile development, I saw an opportunity to create a studio that approaches each project not just as a technical challenge, but as a chance to enhance how people live, work, and connect. Our name reflects this philosophy – like a forest that grows and adapts while maintaining its core essence, we build applications that are both dynamic and deeply rooted in purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;release-early-and-often&#34;&gt;Release Early and Often.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 2025! I&amp;rsquo;m a couple weeks late, but one of my resolutions was to start writing more and this represents my first step in that journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy start to 2025 and I just recently launched my new developer studio &lt;a href=&#34;https://robotforest.dev&#34;&gt;Robot Forest&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to launch this thing for years, and finally got the confidence to do so over the holidays. I also finally submitted version 3.0 of my app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wheels.trevorpiltch.com&#34;&gt;Wheels&lt;/a&gt;, to the app store. This has been one of those projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve been consistently tweaking for almost two years. Every time I thought I&amp;rsquo;d release it, I&amp;rsquo;d come up with another feature to add, implement it, and then repeat the process. With something like this, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that the most important thing is to follow the old software mantra, release early and often. For the longest time, I was the only one with eyes on this version and was overly critical of every detail. By releasing it to the public, I&amp;rsquo;ve already gotten new feedback and praise about the new features. While not the biggest achievement so far, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely proud of this one and excited to break the cycle of feature bloating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was part of a group of seven students, and unanimously voted as the technical leader. For the application, we used Java, Gradle, Cucumber, and JavaFX. Most of the group had never completed an application this large before, and I took it upon myself to teach them some critical software engineering skills. I taught them the basics of git, Java, and how to create an intuitive UI in JavaFX (and not use the default styling).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This project transforms a &lt;a href=&#34;https://microbit.org/&#34;&gt;Micro:Bit v2&lt;/a&gt; into a dedicated Pomodoro timer, bringing the power of focused work sessions right to your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizes the Micro:Bit v2 platform&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software:&lt;/strong&gt; Written in C using open source HAL libraries&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functionality:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternates between 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;personal-impact&#34;&gt;Personal Impact&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since implementing this timer, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m more deliberate with my breaks. Before, I used a phone or mac app to track my breaks and ended up wasting my time on email or social media. This provides a visual and tactile separation between work time and break time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since 2019, I&amp;rsquo;ve kept every actionable item in my life organized in this app. As I got more into software, I realized there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy way to sync the various bug tracking tools to OmniFocus. I found a script written &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mikerhodes/github-to-omnifocus&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (released under the open source ISC license) for syncing GitHub issues to OmniFocus. I loved the tool, although found it restrictive with only importing GitHub issues and only allowing one project at a time. So, I taught myself Go and wrote this project. I now use it everyday (as a toolbar button in OmniFocus) to stay in sync between OmniFocus, GitHub Issues, and Shortcut Stories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I joined the Flight Computer Software project in my first year at the university, and quickly gained an interest in the work. My first project was fixing a timing issue with an I2C bus. I then worked with another member to implement drivers for new acceleration, temperature, and pressure sensors. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was then elected by the team captains to become the new project lead in May 2024. Our planned launch was late August 2024 (at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.launchcanada.org/&#34;&gt;Launch Canada&lt;/a&gt; competition), and I worked throughout the summer to get the system ready for launch. In this time, I re-designed the system to use FreeRTOS and concurrent programming techniques (mutexes, queues, threads, etc.). I also implemented new commands to interface with the propulsion, radio, and payload systems over CAN buses, exhaustively tested a new SD card driver, and implemented a driver for a new video recorder inside the rocket. Although the rocket ultimately didn&amp;rsquo;t fly (due to a faulty fuel valve), the software system worked throughout the testing and various launch attempts. After the competition, I designed the new software system architecture, trained new members, and managed my team of around 8-9 people. I hosted weekly meetings along with work sessions and social events such as hackathons and team wide BBQs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-bessel-function-of-the-first-kind&#34;&gt;The Bessel Function of the First Kind&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I took differential equations in the winter of my first year at McGill. I absolutely loved that class and spent a lot of time after class talking to the professor and spending time learning other aspects of this field of math. One day, we learned about the Frobenius method of solving diff-eqs. Curious, I looked up what I could apply the method to, and found the Bessel Function. I tried deriving the function and wrote up my work below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You flip open your Mac and hear the iconic&#xA;chime. The machine whirs to life, opens its eyes and greets you with the&#xA;familiar, &lt;em&gt;please enter your password&lt;/em&gt;. With the Mac fully awake, you&#xA;can begin your process. Most importantly, is the music, so you open the&#xA;music app and put on some AC/DC. You know you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen to music&#xA;this loud at 11 p.m., but you also should be asleep, so you don&amp;rsquo;t really&#xA;care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blood Cobalt; How International Institutions Failed the Democratic Republic of Congo</title>

According to the World Bank, 64% of its 97 million citizens live on less than \$2.15 a day. The Congolese economy relies heavily on mining, especially of Cobalt. The mineral is essential in lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from phones to electric cars, and 74% of the world&amp;rsquo;s supply comes from the Congo. Cobalt dust is also toxic to breathe and touch, but “artisanal miners” axe away at the mineral all day with nothing but their hands and pickaxes. However, this Cobalt economy is not an accident because the DRC has been purposefully underdeveloped throughout its history. After the Congo’s independence in 1960, the World Bank and IMF shaped the new economy to become heavily reliant on mining while underfunding public infrastructure. This gave western companies the power to exploit resources with very little oversight and high margins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I rode the board almost everyday through my neighborhood, and I wanted to know how fast and far I was going. Since I had just learned Swift a year before, I figured that this was a good opportunity to build a mobile app. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;The app was released to the public in early 2023 and has reached over 500 downloads on every continent. The pace of growth has increased as well, with almost 200 new users joining in the last two months alone. The app has also had a favorable rating on the app store, consitently with 5.0/5.0 stars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I built their internal app in Swift and SwiftUI, interfacing with the live production backend (running on Ruby on Rails). The app helped increase inventory management from around 200 items to over 20000 utilizing QR code scanning and a responsive UI. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;When the company wanted to release their mobile application, the CEO hired me to build it for them. I expanded the iOS application to include a consumer facing side, that includes an artwork photo gallery, artwork lookup, and full account management. I also added system integration through widgets and spotlight to enhance the user experience. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;I then taught myself JetPack compose and Kotlin to implement the app for android devices. This was a fun challenge, as I had never done android development before. The android app has feature parity with the iOS app, and includes the same system integrations, providing a consistent look and feature set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
