                <p id="text">
                Iâ€™m studying software engineering at McGill University in Montreal.
                Iâ€™ve worked with a variety of languages and platforms over the past few years, but my passion is iOS app development.
                My focus is always on the user experience and not just about writing good code.
                <br></br>
                Currently, Iâ€™m working on a skateboard tracking app called Wheels. It takes advantage of a lot of very good Apple frameworks like location, sharing, and activities.
                Itâ€™s been a fun project and one that I use quite often when I ride.
                <br></br>
                Iâ€™m also part of the Rocket Team at McGill, where Iâ€™ve worked on GPS systems and I2C & UART communications.
                Itâ€™s taught me a lot about embedded programming, and Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more.
                <br></br>
                If you have any questions about my work, or want to see if we can work together, you can send me an email of find me on LinkedIn.
                Iâ€™m on Mastodon too, if thatâ€™s your thing. All my open source code is on GitHub if you want to take a look.
                Iâ€™m always open to new projects and ideas!
                </p>
