            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Trevor! I'm studying software engineering at McGill University in Montreal. I've worked with a variety of
                languages and platforms over the past few years, but my passion is iOS app development. My focus is always on the user
                experience and not just about writing good code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm working on a skateboard tracking app called Wheels. It takes advantage of a lot of very good Apple
                frameworks like location, sharing, and activities. It's been a fun project and one that I use quite often when I ride.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also the lead software engineer for the flight computer on the McGill Rocket Team. It's an entirely student run
                club, and we're currently working hard to develop our next generation rocket. In the role, I help manage members tasks
                and also work on some embedded programming myself such as I2C communications and GPS buffer parsing. Check out my work
                section to find out more!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions about my work, or want to see if we can work together, you can send me an email of find me on
                LinkedIn. All my open source code is on GitHub if you want to take a look. I'm always open to new projects and ideas!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's a list of the work I've done over the years. This includes some of my passion projects and a few things
                I've
                developed for others

                    I'm the lead software engineer on the flight computer sub-project. I manage the other members of the FC project
                    and give
                    them advice when writing code. Written in a mix of C and C++, the FC is by far the biggest project I've worked
                    on. I've
                    worked a lot on sensor communication using I2C and low level buffer handling.

                    Wheels is a skateboard ride tracker that tracks your history of riding. When you're riding, you can see all your
                    stats
                    (speed, distance, duration). You can save your skateboard collection, including cruisers, longboards, and electric
                    boards. You can join a group ride with others and view your riding status on the home screen with widgets and live
                    activities.

                    AlwaysArt is a startup looking to connect artists, galleries, and collectors. I've been working on an iOS app to
                    help
                    manage inventory that includes server connections, QR scanning, and authentication. The app has plans to be released
                    to
                    the public but it's currently only available to AlwaysArt employees.

                I like to tinker with things in my free time and I'm always looking 
                to learn new languages and frameworks. These don't constitue a full 
                project, per say, but they're still fun to work on. Here you can find 
                a collection of repos, scripts, and notes I use for learning and 
                gaining hands-on experience.

                <p>
                    For my role as the lead of Flight Computer software on the Rocket Team, I was 
                    tasked with writing the real time operating system (RTOS) for the 2024 design cycle. 
                    I was doing some tutorials that mentioned some assembly debugging, which I didn't fully understand. 
                    I figured this was  a perfect opportunity to learn assembly. I found a book and began doing the exercises. 
                    This repo contains all the code and scripts I've created.

                <p>
                    I got a Micro:bit v2 a year or so ago and I used it to learn embedded Rust. However, 
                    it was tedious to set up the project every time I wanted to start a new one. So, I made a
                    template that you can download using the cargo command.

            I used to dislike writing, but I've come to enjoy it more and more. I've started to write about some 
            of the things I'm interesting in from my classes, personal projects, and random thoughts. 
            There also might be the occasional rant in here too.

                <p>
                    For my final english assignment at Phillips Exeter Academy, I had to write a personal
                    essay about anything of my choosing. I was selected as one of 18 students from the 300 person class
                    to read aloud at the school church in front of the faculty and students. Aptly called the "Meditation", it
                    was a three month
                    project and one of the most rewarding things I've ever written.

                <p>
                    I was sitting in my differential equations class the other day when I was introduced
                    to the Frobenius method. Curious, I searched up some applications of the equation and
                    found the Bessel function. Here are my notes on the derivation of the function.
