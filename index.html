                    <p id="text">
                    Iâ€™m studying software engineering at McGill University in Montreal.
                    Iâ€™ve worked with a variety of languages and platforms over the past few years, but my passion is iOS app development.
                    My focus is always on the user experience and not just about writing good code.
                    <br></br>
                    Currently, Iâ€™m working on a skateboard tracking app called Wheels. It takes advantage of a lot of very good Apple frameworks like location, sharing, and activities.
                    Itâ€™s been a fun project and one that I use quite often when I ride.
                    <br></br>
                    Iâ€™m also part of the Rocket Team at McGill, where Iâ€™ve worked on GPS systems and I2C & UART communications.
                    Itâ€™s taught me a lot about embedded programming, and Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more.
                    <br></br>
                    If you have any questions about my work, or want to see if we can work together, you can send me an email of find me on LinkedIn.
                    Iâ€™m on Mastodon too, if thatâ€™s your thing. All my open source code is on GitHub if you want to take a look.
                    Iâ€™m always open to new projects and ideas!
                    </p>

                                Wheels is a skateboard ride tracker that tracks your history of riding.
                                When youâ€™re riding, you can see all your stats (speed, distance, duration).
                                You can save your skateboard collection, including cruisers, longboards, and electric boards.
                                You can join a group ride with others and view your riding status on the home screen with
                                widgets and live activities.

                        A Java project created for school that implements Huffman encoding for a given string.
                        This was one of my first big projects, so itâ€™s not the most efficient implementation but it was a
                        fun project and I learned a lot about compression algorithms.
