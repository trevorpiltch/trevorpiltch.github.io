            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Trevor! I'm studying software engineering at McGill University in Montreal. I've worked with a variety of
                languages and platforms over the past few years, but my passion is iOS app development. My focus is always on the user
                experience and not just about writing good code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm working on a skateboard tracking app called Wheels. It takes advantage of a lot of very good Apple
                frameworks like location, sharing, and activities. It's been a fun project and one that I use quite often when I ride.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also the lead software engineer for the flight computer on the McGill Rocket Team. It's an entirely student run
                club, and we're currently working hard to develop our next generation rocket. In the role, I help manage members tasks
                and also work on some embedded programming myself such as I2C communications and GPS buffer parsing. Check out my work
                section to find out more!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions about my work, or want to see if we can work together, you can send me an email of find me on
                LinkedIn. I'm on Mastodon too, if that's your thing. All my open source code is on GitHub if you want to take a look.
                I'm always open to new projects and ideas!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's a list of the work I've done over the years. This includes some of my passion projects and a few things
                I've
                developed for others

                    I'm the lead software engineer on the flight computer sub-project. I manage the other members of the FC project
                    and give
                    them advice when writing code. Written in a mix of C and C++, the FC is by far the biggest project I've worked
                    on. I've
                    worked a lot on sensor communication using I2C and low level buffer handling.

                    Wheels is a skateboard ride tracker that tracks your history of riding. When you're riding, you can see all your
                    stats
                    (speed, distance, duration). You can save your skateboard collection, including cruisers, longboards, and electric
                    boards. You can join a group ride with others and view your riding status on the home screen with widgets and live
                    activities.

                    AlwaysArt is a startup looking to connect artists, galleries, and collectors. I've been working on an iOS app to
                    help
                    manage inventory that includes server connections, QR scanning, and authentication. The app has plans to be released
                    to
                    the public but it's currently only available to AlwaysArt employees.
