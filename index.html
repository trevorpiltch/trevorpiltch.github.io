            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Trevor! I'm studying software engineering at McGill University in Montreal. I've worked with a variety of
                languages and platforms over the past few years, but my passion is iOS app development and low level programming. I love learning 
                and I'm always learning a new language or framework (check out my labs section to see what I'm currently learning!) 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm the lead software engineer for the flight computer project on the McGill Rocket Team. It's an entirely student run
                club and we've won multiple awards in the past few years. As lead, I'm in charge of architecting the whole software system 
                and managing tasks for the general members to work on. I like taking on the more challenging tasks and I've solved 
                an I2C bus bug and written a real time operating system to manage the sensor inputs and ejection circuits. Check out my work 
                section to learn more!
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my non-academic passions is skateboarding, and I'm working on a skateboard companion app called Wheels. It 
                stores your riding routes and history and keeps track of your boards. It helps me to see what my riding stats (speed, distance, duration)
                are and how often I'm using specific boards. It's been a very fun project and one that I use every time I ride.  
            </p>
           <p>
                If you have any questions about my work, or want to see if we can work together, you can send me an email or find me on
                LinkedIn. All my open source code is on GitHub if you want to take a look. I'm always open to new projects and ideas!

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a list of the work I've done over the years. This includes some of my passion projects and a few things
                I've developed for others
            </p>

                <p>
                    I was elected as the flight computer software lead by the previous flight computer leads and team captains. In the role, 
                    I make all the high level decisions about the software project including the codebase architecture, testing strategies, and 
                    which tools/frameworks to use. I also assign work to the general members and assist them if any problems arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the technically curious, the codebase is written in C and C++ for the STM32 microcontroller. The flight computer
                    hardware is also entirely student created, and includes different sensors for temperature, pressure, acceleration, and magnetic 
                    orientation. The software system takes all these inputs (through the I2C protocal) and manages the flight trajectory of the rocket. 
                    At over one gb and thousands of lines of code, it's the biggest project I've ever worked on.

                <p>
                    Wheels is a skateboard ride tracker that tracks your history of riding. When you're riding, you can see all your
                    stats
                    (speed, distance, duration). You can save your skateboard collection, including cruisers, longboards, and electric
                    boards. You can join a group ride with others and view your riding status on the home screen with widgets and live
                    activities. <br>
                    I created Wheels over the summer between sophomore and junior year of high school, and I've been the sole developer
                    ever since. It's been an interesting journey, and I've learned a lot about running a project solo.

                    AlwaysArt is a startup looking to connect artists, galleries, and collectors. I've been working on an iOS app to
                    help manage inventory that includes server connections, QR scanning, and authentication. The app has helped
                    the company increase inventory from a few hundred to over 26,000 artwork items. <br>
                    I'm part of a team of four developers that use agile workflows to manage tasks, project timelines, and requirements gathering.
                    The team includes a backend developer, frontend developer, mobile developer (me), and manager. The backend/frontend is
                    written using Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript.

                I like to tinker with things in my free time and I'm always looking 
                to learn new languages and frameworks. These don't constitue a full 
                project, per say, but they're still fun to work on. Here you can find 
                a collection of repos, scripts, and notes I use for learning and 
                gaining hands-on experience. All of these are combined into my labs repo, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/trevorpiltch/Labs">here</a>

                <p>
                    For my role as the lead of Flight Computer software on the Rocket Team, I was 
                    tasked with writing the real time operating system (RTOS) for the 2024 design cycle. 
                    I was doing some tutorials that mentioned some assembly debugging, which I didn't fully understand. 
                    I figured this was a perfect opportunity to learn assembly. I found a book and began doing the exercises. 
                    This repo contains all the code and scripts I've created.

                <p>
                    I wanted to learn embedded rust, so I bought a Micro:bit v2. However, 
                    it was tedious to set up the project (with all the binaries and configurations) every time I wanted to start a new one. So, I made a
                    template that you can download using the cargo command.

            I used to dislike writing, but I've come to enjoy it more and more. I've started to write about some 
            of the things I'm interesting in from my classes, personal projects, and random thoughts. 
            There also might be the occasional rant in here too.

                <p>
                    For my final english assignment at Phillips Exeter Academy, I had to write a personal
                    essay about anything of my choosing. I was selected as one of 18 students from the 300 person class
                    to read aloud at the school church in front of the faculty and students. Aptly called the "Meditation", it
                    was a three month project and one of the most rewarding things I've ever written.

                    I was sitting in my differential equations class when I was introduced
                    to the Frobenius method. Curious, I searched up some applications of the equation and
                    found the Bessel function. Here are my notes on the derivation of the function.
