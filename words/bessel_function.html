  <p> I was sitting in my differential equations class the other day when I was introduced to the Frobenius method. Curious,
  I searched up some applications of the method and fell down a deep math Wikipedia rabbit whole. Luckily, I managed to escape 
  and ended up at <a href="https://www.math.arizona.edu/~zakharov/BesselFunctions.pdf">this</a> article about the Bessel function. It's a really interesting article 
  and so I decided to see if I could derive it from the Frobenius method. 
  </p>
  <p>Let’s analyze Bessel’s equation. It’s common to refer to the parameter p as the <em>order</em> of the equation.: <span class="math display">\[x^2y&#39;&#39;+xy&#39;+(x^2-p^2)y=0\]</span> To
  start, let’s get this in standard form by dividing by <span
  class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>: 
  <span class="math inline">\(y'' + y' + (1-\frac{p^2}{x^2})y=0\)</span> <span
  class="math inline">\(%\)</span> This should be ringing some alarm bells
  with <em>x</em> in the denominator, as <span
  class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> makes this undefined. So we say <span
  class="math inline">\(x_0=0\)</span> is a <em>singular point</em>. Let’s
  check if it’s regular by checking 
  <span class="math inline">\(x\frac{Q}{P}\)</span> and 
  <span class="math inline">\(x^2\frac{R}{P}\)</span> : <span
  class="math display">\[x\frac{Q}{P}=1\]</span> <span
  class="math display">\[x^2\frac{R}{P}=x^2-p^2\]</span> These are both
  analytic functions and are well defined for all x in <span
  class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Notice that this means <span
  class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> is a <em>regular singular point</em>.
  The next step in analyzing this ODE is to find the roots of the indicial
  equation. Recall the indicial equation is defined as <span
  class="math inline">\(F(r)=r(r-1)+b_0r+c_0=0\)</span> Using the
  expressions from <span class="math inline">\(x\frac{Q}{P}\)</span> and
  <span class="math inline">\(x^2\frac{R}{P}\)</span>, we get the
  expansions: <span class="math display">\[x\frac{Q}{P}=1+(0)O(x)\]</span>
  <span
  class="math display">\[x^2\frac{R}{P}=-p^2+0x+x^2+(0)O(x^3)\]</span>
  From these, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(b_0=1\)</span>
  and <span class="math inline">\(c_0=-p^2\)</span> and the only other
  non-zero coefficient is <span class="math inline">\(c_2=1\)</span>.
  Let’s plug this back into our indicial equation and solve for the roots.
  <span class="math display">\[F(r)=r(r-1)+r-p^2\]</span> <span
  class="math display">\[=r^2-r+r-p^2\]</span> <span
  class="math inline">\(r^2-p^2\)</span> <span
  class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow r=± p\)</span> For this example, we’re
  only going to take <span class="math inline">\(r=p\)</span> but the
  process for <span class="math inline">\(r=-p\)</span> is the same. Let’s
  calculate the first few coefficients using the <em>method of
  frobenius</em>: <span
  class="math display">\[a_n=\frac{-1}{F(n+p)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a_k[(k+p)b_{n-k}+c_{n-k}]\]</span>
  <span class="math display">\[a_1=\frac{-1}{F(1+p)}(0)=0\]</span> <span
  class="math display">\[a_2=\frac{-1}{F(2+p)}\sum_{k=0}^{1}a_k[(k+p)b_{2-k}+c_{2-k}]=\frac{-1}{F(2+p)}a_0\]</span>
  <span
  class="math display">\[a_3=\frac{-1}{F(3+p)}\sum_{k=0}^{2}a_k[(k+p)b_{3-k}+c_{3-k}]=\frac{-1}{F(3+p)}a_1\]</span>
  <span
  class="math display">\[a_4=\frac{-1}{F(4+p)}\sum_{k=0}^{4}a_k[(k+p)b_{4-k}+c_{4-k}]=\frac{-1}{F(4+p)}a_2\]</span></p>
  <p>Hopefully you’ve noticed a pattern here. The general term of <span
  class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> is given by <span
  class="math display">\[a_n=\frac{-a_{n-2}}{F(n+p)}\]</span> However, we
  can simplify this quite nicely by noticing that all the odd coefficients
  depend on <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> which is identically
  equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. So we can reindex to
  only take the odd indicies and evaluate our function <span
  class="math inline">\(F(n+p)\)</span>: <span
  class="math display">\[a_{2n}=\frac{-a_{2n-2}}{4n(n+p)}\]</span> Let’s
  find the first few terms explicitly: <span
  class="math display">\[a_2=\frac{-a_0}{4*1(1+p)}\]</span> <span
  class="math inline">\(a_4=\frac{-a_2}{4*2*(2+p)}=\frac{(-1)^2a_0}{4^22*1(1+p)(2+p)}\)</span>
  <span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span> <span
  class="math display">\[a_{2n}=\frac{(-1)^ka_0}{4^kk!(1+p)\dots(2+p)}\]</span>
  To simplify our calculations, we introduce the gamma function, which is
  a generalized factorial where <span
  class="math inline">\(\Gamma(x+1)=x!\)</span>: <span
  class="math display">\[\Gamma(x)=\int_0^{\infty}e^{-t}t^{x-1}dt\]</span>
  We’ll replace that in our expression to get: <span
  class="math display">\[a_{2n}=\frac{(-1)^ka_0}{4^k\Gamma(k+1)\Gamma(k+p+1)}\]</span>
  To get the Bessel function, we’ll take <span
  class="math inline">\(a_0=\frac{1}{2^p\Gamma(p+1)}\)</span>: <span
  class="math display">\[a_{2n}=\frac{(-1)^ka_0}{4^k2^p\Gamma(k+1)\Gamma(k+p+1)}\]</span>
  When we plug this into our series solution <span
  class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span>, we get <span
  class="math display">\[y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(p+k+1)}(\frac{x}{2})^{2n+p}\]</span>
  And thus we have arrived at the Bessel function of the first kind,
  normally denoted by <span class="math inline">\(J_1(x)\)</span>: <span
  class="math display">\[J_1(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(p+k+1)}(\frac{x}{2})^{2n+p}\]</span></p>

    As you can see, this is a pretty complicated function, but it has some nice practical uses. For example, it can be used to model vibrations in a circular drum. 
    It's also useful for solving a whole host of ODEs in cylindrical coordinates and is a key part of the solution to the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates.
    Overall, it's a pretty cool function and I'm glad I fell down the Wikipedia rabbit hole to learn about it.
